												<p>During the last week of my OJT at Sorsogon East Central School (SECS), we were assigned to perform maintenance on the printers throughout the school. This involved troubleshooting any issues, fixing malfunctions, and ensuring that all printers were running smoothly. We also carried out routine cleaning and deep cleaning tasks to maintain the machines' longevity and efficiency. This week was a hands-on conclusion to our technical duties, ensuring the school's equipment was fully operational as we wrapped up our internship.</p>
